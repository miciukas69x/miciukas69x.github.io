Sometimes the best way to learn is to wire things together and see what breaks. This AI agent was my experiment in connecting a language model to real-world tasks."</blockquote><p><a href="github.com/miciukas69x">View on GitHub</a> (not done yet)</p><h2>Introduction</h2><p>This project is a small AI agent I built using a free Google API as the language model backend. The goal was simple: understand the structure of AI agents, how they interact with APIs, and how to make them perform specific tasks automatically.</p><h2>Core Features</h2><ul><li>Command-line interface for input and output</li><li>Uses a free API endpoint as the LLM engine</li><li>Basic tool calling (fetching data, returning results)</li><li>Modular design for adding more tools or actions</li><li>Logs interactions for debugging and iteration</li></ul><h2>What I Learned</h2><ul><li>How AI agents are structured (loop of input → model → action → response)</li><li>The role of APIs in extending model capabilities</li><li>Handling async tasks and API errors gracefully</li><li>Why abstraction matters: separating the agent logic from the tools it can use</li><li>That even a toy project can teach the fundamentals of bigger frameworks like LangChain or AutoGPTin songs, his tale remains an inspiration, an immortal testament to courage—a rarity that transcends time.</li></ul><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>The AI Agent project showed me that it’s not magic — it’s just code, APIs, and a loop. By building one from scratch, I demystified how agents work and laid the groundwork for more advanced projects that combine finance, coding, and automation.</p></div></article>
