I created it to understand how websites can be built from plain text and templates without relying on frameworks. Every page on this site is generated with it.</p><h2>Core Features</h2><ul><li>Converts Markdown (.md) files into HTML.</li><li>Applies a shared template (template.html) across all pages.</li><li>Copies assets from static/ into to the output folder.</li><li>Generates blog posts, project pages, and a homepage.</li><li>Simple shell scripts for building and previewing (./build.sh  ./main.sh).</li></ul><h2>What I learned</h2><ul><li>How Markdown parsing works (blocks, inline styles, code snippets).</li><li>Writing file-system logic to recursively generate pages.</li><li>Using Python modules to keep code clean and reusable.</li><li>Why <b>templates</b> are powerful for consistent design.</li><li>The discipline of "eat your own dogfood"</li></ul><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>This project gave me a deeper appreciation for how static site tool like Hugo or Jekyll work under the hood. It's not about just having a site - it's about knowing how to make the tool that makes the website. The SSG started as a learning exercise, but now it's the backbone of my personal site and a foundation I can keep expanding.</p></div></article>
